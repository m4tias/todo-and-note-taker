## To-Doer and Note taker

So, just to have some fun and learn new things during quarantine, I decided to make this simple app using electron. It's the classic TO-DO app plus a little extra.

The little extra would be a "sticky" part just to have within easy reach things that we always need (e.g. VPN passwords that are hard sometimes or things like that) and a button to copy them quickly to our clipboard.

Also, the TO-DO part has a nice progress bar to feed your own ego ðŸ¤ª.
The design and idea was taken mostly from [here](https://github.com/cassidoo/todometer).

## Download

```
$ git clone https://github.com/m4tias/todo-and-note-taker.git
$ cd todo-and-note-taker && npm install
```

To start the app:
```
$ npm start
```
Once it's up:
```
$ npm run start-electron
```

## That's all

Folks
